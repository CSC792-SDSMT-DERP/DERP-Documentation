\subsection{Language Constraints}
There are a few constraints on the interpreter implementation for the DERP-Query Language. These are mainly based around the keywords defined in the \autoref{sub:DerpOperators}.\\
\\The following must be defined for the main selection mode:

\begin{itemize}
    \item create 
    \item clear
    \item read
    \item exit 
\end{itemize}

\noindent The following must be defined for the selection and criteria modes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item add
    \item remove
    \item clear
    \item recall
    \item save as
    \item read
    \item stop
\end{itemize}

\noindent Also all modules loaded must must not define their own keywords that are the same as interpreter keywords.
