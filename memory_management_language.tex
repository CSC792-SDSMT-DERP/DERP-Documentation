\subsection{Memory Management}
Memory management is automatic, and handled by the Python runtime. Selections, and criteria are persisted to files, and loaded into their representative objects at runtime. When selections or criteria are composed, they are composed by value rather than reference. This prevents dependency issues when criteria or selections are removed from the system.
